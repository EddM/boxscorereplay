<h2>Available Box Score Replays</h2>

<p class="w20pc float-right lighter smaller">
  Use Box Score Replay to progressively "replay" an NBA game's statistics, from tip-off to 
  overtime so you can watch a game's box score unfold, spoiler-free, or pinpoint a player's 
  stats at any point during a game.
  <br /><br />

  Games are automatically added as soon as data is available. Some may take longer than 
  others &mdash; sorry!
