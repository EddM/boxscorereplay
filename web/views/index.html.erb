  <h2>Available Box Score Replays</h2>

  <p class="intro">
    Use Box Score Replay to progressively "replay" an NBA game's box score, from tip-off to 
    overtime so you can watch a game's stats unfold, spoiler-free, or pinpoint a player's 
    performance at any point during a game.
    <br /><br />

    Games are automatically added as soon as data is available. Some may take longer than 
    others &mdash; sorry!
    <br /><br />
